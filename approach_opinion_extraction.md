Approach-

1. We created dependency tree using NLTK to understand the text data.

2. We used SpaCy to extract Subject from the text and based on the text we found their related Adjective, Preposition etc by iterating over the tree. We stored them in a dictionary and this dictionary is nothing but the opinion or reviews.
